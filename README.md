# Project Name

Welcome to the **NJC Bandwidth** frontend repository! This project is built using modern web development practices with React. Below you will find all the necessary steps to get started, run the development server, build for production, and troubleshoot common issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or later is recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js. Ensure you have it available in your terminal.

### Installation
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:  
   **cd frontend**

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   **npm install**  

   *Troubleshooting:* If you encounter any errors during installation, try running:  
   **npm install --legacy-peer-deps**

## Running the Development Server
To start the development server with hot reloading and debugging support, run:  
**npm run dev**  

This command will launch the server (usually at http://localhost:3000) where you can see your application live as you make changes.

## Building for Production
When you're ready to deploy your application, create an optimized production build with:  
**npm run build**  

This command bundles your application into an optimized folder (often `dist` or `build`). You can then deploy these files to your hosting provider.

## Project Structure
- **frontend/**: Contains all source code for the frontend.  
  - **src/**: Your React components, assets, and styles.  
  - **public/**: Static files and the main HTML file.  
  - **package.json**: Contains project dependencies and scripts.

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- **Dependency Issues**: If you run into errors during `npm install`, try using the legacy peer dependency flag:  
  **npm install --legacy-peer-deps**  

- **Development Workflow**:  
  - Commit your changes frequently.  
  - Use branches for new features or bug fixes.  

- **Contributing**: Contributions are welcome! Please follow the coding style guidelines and add tests where necessary.  
- **Further Documentation**: Check the `docs/` folder or refer to the project wiki for more detailed information.
